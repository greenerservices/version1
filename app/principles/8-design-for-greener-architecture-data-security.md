## Further reading

The Green Software Foundation have developed a set of [patterns and techniques](https://patterns.greensoftware.foundation/) to reduce the environmental impacts of digital services. These are broken down by 'web' and 'cloud'.

The W3C's draft [Web Sustainability Guidelines](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/) include comprehensive recommendations for reducing the environmental impacts of websites and digital products. Guidance comes under the following categories: user experience design, web development, hosting and infrastructure and business and product management considerations.

The [Handbook of Sustainable Design of Digital Services](https://gr491.isit-europe.org/en/), known as GR491, was created in France by the 'Institute for Sustainable IT'. It covers a range of recommendations for delivering digital services with reduced environmental footprints.
