Suppliers may provide a range of services, for example:

• hardware, software and infrastructure services (such as cloud providers)
• design and delivery of services
• operating a live service 

The rules around public sector procurement changed on 24 February 2025. The Procurement Act 2023 will improve and streamline procurement. This will support suppliers of all sizes, particularly small businesses, start-ups and social enterprises.
