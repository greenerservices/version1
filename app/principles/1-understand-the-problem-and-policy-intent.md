We need to understand policy intent and any particular sustainability goals as part of the problem space for a service.

<div class="govuk-inset-text app-wcag-callout">
  <p class="govuk-body">This principle should be applied before service delivery begins, when a range of interventions, including non-digital, may be under consideration. It is important as decisions may be made up front about the nature of a service, about the technology that will be used to enable it, and this may be embedded in primary legislation.</p>
