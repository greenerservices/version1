We need to measure the environmental impacts of our services in order to be confident our actions reducing these. Publishing our approaches to measurement and results is also a key step in developing a culture of transparency and learning.

What if we cannot quantify a serviceâ€™s environmental impacts?

If you are not yet able to accurately measure you service's emissions, make a start with what you can access. This could include tools to help with estimating impacts, using proxie measures, or following the approach of best practice examples to help reduce resource consumption. For example, only collect and store the information you need.

NB: A cross-government working group is looking at standardised methods for measuring environmental impacts. This principle will updated with their outputs.
