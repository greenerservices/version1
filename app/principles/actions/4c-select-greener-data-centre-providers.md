###  (i) Choose providers with regions with renewable energy available

Select cloud provider regions where the grid carbon intensity is the lowest, where possible.

Choose cloud providers with higher proportion of energy consumed by the data centre that comes from renewable resources.

NB. Government departments may be constrained to choosing regions within the UK for reasons of data sovereignty

###  (ii) Choose providers monitoring energy and water usage

The energy efficiency of a data centre is often expressed in terms of Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is a metric for the overall energy efficiency of a data center facility. It is calculated by dividing the total amount of energy consumed by the facility by the energy used specifically by the IT equipment.

Water plays an essential role in cooling data centres. Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) is a measure of water efficiency. Tracking water use is even more important in areas of water stress and where free cooling is not used.

###  (iii) Ensure providers supply reporting tools and actionable data on environmental impact

Check providers have tools available to estimate, monitor and manage cloud environmental footprint. 

When working with hyperscalers, confirm that these tools and professional services are available where your organization is consuming cloud services.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Ensure Cloud Provider supply tools for reporting on environmental impact and actionable data on carbon intensity
