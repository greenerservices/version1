###  (i) Use remanufactured equipment where possible

Use remanufactured or recycled technology if your service purchases equipment or infrastructure. This reduces the need to purchase new.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Reduces the impacts of purchasing new.

###  (iii) Consider 'pace' of service and response times

Make a plan to retire all service equipment. 

When assessing options for disposal, consider: 

• any sustainable disposal options, such as buy-back schemes
• reusing equipment on other projects or programmes
• recycling equipment that cannot be reused

#### Environmental benefit: 
Services with a slower pace often require fewer resources to deliver.
