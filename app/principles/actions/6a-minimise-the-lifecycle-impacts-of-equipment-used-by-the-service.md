###  (iii) Have a plan for end of life

Make a plan to retire all service equipment. 

When assessing options for disposal, consider: 

• any sustainable disposal options, such as buy-back schemes
• reusing equipment on other projects or programmes
• recycling equipment that cannot be reused

#### Environmental benefit: 
Reusing, refurbishing or recycling equipment at the end of its life save on the environmental impacts of manufacturing new equipment from virgin materials.
