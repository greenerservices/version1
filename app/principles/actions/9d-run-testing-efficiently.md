###  (i) Choose efficient testing tools

Use test tools and frameworks that consume less resource- including unit, integration, performance and security test tools. 

#### Environmental benefit: 
Reduced resource consumption.

{{ govukDetails({

}) }}

###  (ii) Test designs on representative devices and platforms

Test design on different platforms and devices, including older devices. This can identify inefficiencies.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Identifying inefficiencies can help reduce energy demands.

### (iii) Run tests in parallel

Running tests in parallel uses resources for a shorter time. Consider running tests when the grid is greener.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Using resources for less time and when the grid is greener cuts carbon footprint.

### (iv) Switch off test environments after use

Testing environments mimic production environments. They can be switched off when not in use.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Turning off testing environments when not in use cuts energy consumption.
