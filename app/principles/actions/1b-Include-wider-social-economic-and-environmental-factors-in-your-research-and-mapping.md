###  (i) Conduct research with array of stakeholders

Map stakeholders to environmental aspects of your project. Include as many stakeholders as possible, including direct users and funders or owners.

Use a variety of recruitment methods to attract a range of participants. Include participants who reflect social, economic and environmental factors.

###  (ii) Map the problem space as a system

System mapping can be both qualitative and quantitative. It allows you to:

* identify the environmental impacts you need to measure
* model the impacts of intervention

You should identify:
* points where intervention can help achieve desired outcomes
* any unintended consequences or knock on effects of intervention
