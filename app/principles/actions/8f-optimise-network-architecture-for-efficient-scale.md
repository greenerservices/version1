###  (i) Compress data for transit

Compression minimises the amount of data sent over a network.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Compressing data in transit reduces payload sizes, helping reduce network load and emissions.

###  (ii) Enable consumption of data from primary source

Placeholder

#### Environmental benefit: 
Reduces data processing, storage  and network transmission energy, leading to lower carbon emissions and improved resource efficiency.

###  (iii) Use efficient protocols

A network protocol is a set of rules that define how data is exchanged between devices on a network. Using efficient protocols like UDP based HTTP3 or QUIC can help reduce retransmissions.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Efficient protocols help reduce energy-associated emissions.

###  (iv) Utilise edge computing

Edge computing means storing and processing data at the 'edge' of networks. This means it is much closer to the devices that produce it and the users who consume it.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Processing data closer to the user reduces network load and energy consumption.
