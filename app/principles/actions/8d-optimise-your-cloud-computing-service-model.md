###  (i) Move from rented Infrastructure to Platform and Serverless solutions where appropriate

Serverless architecture lets us create and run application without having to manage infrastructure.

Move from rented Infrastructure (IaaS) to Platform (PaaS) and Serverless solutions where appropriate

#### Environmental benefit: 
Serverless architectures allow flexibility, scalability and higher efficiency.

###  (iii) Design workloads for portability to optimise resource efficiency and sustainability

Designing for portability allows you to move application and data between cloud environments. This includes moving them between public and private cloud, or between different providers.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Allows workloads to run in different data centres when low carbon electricity is available.
