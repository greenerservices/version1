###  (i) Reduce consumption of paper, printing and postage where appropriate

Paper might be used for physical documents that users fill out and submit to access services. Consider if online options could replace use of paper. 

Remember that sometimes it will be needed to support digitally excluded users.

Make sure inspectors have the most suitable device for field work. For example, vets in Defra use paper rather than tablets. 

#### Environmental benefit: 
Reducing paper usage can lead to big savings on energy and carbon.

###  (ii) Minimise travel where appropriate

Services can require users or staff to travel. Always allow people to make an informed decision about when to travel.

If travel is required, coordinating visits or inspection can cut the amount of travel.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Reducing travel means less energy and direct greenhouse gas emissions.
