###  (i) Ensure measurement tooling is available
Hosting platforms should provide access to tools or data to measure cost and emissions. Use service level objectives (SLOs) to set up automated reporting and dashboards.   

{% from "govuk/components/details/macro.njk" import govukDetails %}

{{ govukDetails({
  summaryText: "Read more",
  text: "Some placeholder text"
}) }}

* * *

###  (ii) Measure per transaction
Define key metrics for reporting like energy usage and carbon emissions. Measuring on a per transaction basis for workloads will support data-driven decision-making.  

{{ govukDetails({
  summaryText: "Read more",
  text: "Some placeholder text"
}) }}

* * *

### (iii) Apply tagging to resources

Tagging resources builds on good FinOps practice. It enables granular reporting of consumption and emissions.

{{ govukDetails({
  summaryText: "Read more",
  text: "Some placeholder text"
}) }}

### (iv) Measure application performance

Continue measuring performance to check the impact of other changes on delivery.
