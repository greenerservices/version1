The Greening Government Commitments set cross-government targets for carbon reduction from ICT, water use.

###  (i) Be clear on the use case for AI

Be clear on the use case for GenAI/LLMs and whether an alternative non-generative AI approach e.g. image recognition, natural language processing would be more appropriate.

[AI Playbook for the UK Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-playbook-for-the-uk-government/artificial-intelligence-playbook-for-the-uk-government-html#using-ai-safely-and-responsibly): 'Assess the environmental impact of training and/or deploying your AI system before commencing development. Consider whether the impact represents a reasonable trade-off between benefits and energy consumption, and whether a less energy-intensive system might be able to achieve the same or similar results.'

###  (ii) Choose the appropriate size model

Services will use AI for different tasks. Small AI models can be trained for a specific task, are cost effective, quick (as there is less data for them to reference) and they can be run on basic hardware (such as a PC or phone).

Having good AI evaluation/performance metrics will allow teams to make effective choices about the smallest model they can 'get away with' using.

###  (iii) Reuse existing models where possible

Consider building on an existing model rather than starting a new one from scratch.

###  (iv) Carefully choose supplier and region

Choosing the right AI supplier and location is important. You can reduce the carbon footprint by training models in low-carbon regions or times of day.

Keep in mind the other environmental impacts of AI, especially water use. Always consider regional differences. For example. water use will have a different impact in Scotland than Suffolk.

Use third-party auditors to help select the most environmentally-friendly supplier.

Teams might be able to swap a well-known model for a more sustainable and similarly-effective option (e.g. DistilBERT vs BERT) - especially if they have the service performance metrics to support their decision
