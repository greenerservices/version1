The Greening Government Commitments lay out the actions UK government departments and their agencies will take to reduce their impacts on the environment.

Businesses commonly set broad sustaiability goals under the 'ESG' framework. For larger organisations, reporting on Scope 1 (direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by the company) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy) is mandatory.

###  (ii) Choose suppliers that have committed to carbon reduction plans and Science Based Targets across their supply chains

Carbon emission reduction targets will form part of an organisation's ESG strategy. A Carbon Reduction Plan provides a visible way to measure your supply chain’s impact on your organisation’s carbon footprint

For any size of contract you should check suppliers:
- have committed to meeting the government's NetZero targets
- published a carbon reduction plan
