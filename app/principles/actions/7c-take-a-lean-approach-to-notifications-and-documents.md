###  (i) Take a lean approach to notifications

Notifications like emails have a carbon footprint. This can increase when they have attachments. 

Only send emails, SMS, website and other notifications when needed and keep them lightweight. Set up notifications so users can turn them off or choose how often to receive them.  

#### Environmental benefit: 
Reduced data transfer

{% from "govuk/components/details/macro.njk" import govukDetails %}

{{ govukDetails({
  summaryText: "Read more",
  text: "Some placeholder text"
}) }}
* * *

###  (ii) Choose lightweight publishing formats

Document format choices can impact file sizes and data transfer. For example, the HTML publishing format has lower file sizes than PDFs.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Using smaller documents sizes mean less data transfer and energy use.

{{ govukDetails({
  summaryText: "Read more",
  html: "Placeholder"
}) }}
