###  (i) Use energy efficient languages

There are differences between the energy consumption of programming languages. Consider:

• memory usage and speed
• if the language is a ‘compiled’ one

#### Environmental benefit: 
Choosing an energy efficient programming language cuts consumption.

}) }}

###  (ii) Use lightweight frameworks

Software frameworks help developers build applications by providing a structure for code. Some frameworks use less memory than others. Examples include Django, React and Spring.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Choosing lightweight frameworks reduces computational demands in the browser.

}) }}

### (iii) Consider the benefits of low code or no code

Low-code or no-code are methods of designing and developing apps using drag and drop tools.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Choosing a low code or no code approach reduces the time and resources required to develop software.
