When users fail to complete their tasks on a service, this creates 'failure demand'. More resources are needed for follow up enquiries and providing user support.

###  (i) Use established service and design patterns

Patterns can be divided into:

- A design pattern is a general solution to a common problem in software design
- A service patterns provides a solution to common service design problem or user task

#### Environmental benefit: 
Common design and service patterns are familiar for users. They help users quickly navigate and complete tasks.

{{ govukDetails({
  summaryText: "Read more",
  text: "Some placeholder text"
}) }}

###  (ii) Use progessive enhancement

Progressive enhancement is a way of building websites and page where base functionality and content works in html alone. Enhancements are then built on top of this base.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Websites using progressive enhancement perform well across different devices and network condition. This helps users complete their journeys successfully.

}) }}

###  (iii) Consider pace of service and response times

The pace of a service is the speed or rate it is delivered at. This includes response time, processing time and task completion time.

Faster services can need more resources. For example, consider how soon users need a response or outcome and if this could be delivered the next day.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Services with a slower pace often require fewer resources to deliver.

{{ govukDetails({
  summaryText: "Read more",
  html: "Placeholder"
}) }}

###  (iv) Consider appropriate service signposting and search engine optimisation

Search engine optimisation (SEO) is a key factor in helping users find the service they need. A page with good SEO is a webpage that is optimized for search engines and ultimately will rank well on search engine results pages (SERPs) when users search for related terms. 

Good SEO helps users find entry points to services. 

Understand when to signpost users to other content, for example guidance or related services.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Good SEO helps users find the pages and services they need quickly, thereby reducing resource consumption. 

Content that is easy to understand helps users quickly achieve their goals. This will reduce energy usage.
