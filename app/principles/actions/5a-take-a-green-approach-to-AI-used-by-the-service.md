AI can help meet sustainability goals. It might help increase efficiency by reducing costs, emissions and waste by monitoring:

• energy consumption
• hardware use
• data storage

AI might also help analyse data to support services, for example satellite of weather data.

But AI is also resource hungry. For example, training models use large amounts of water. The AI Playbook highlights that:

• the resource consumption used by some AI technologies can present risks
• it is usually more sustainable to use an appropriate pre-trained AI model than to train your own.
• generative AI can be expensive, it should not be used for tasks that can be done by other technologies

###  (i) Be clear on the use case for AI

Be clear on the use case for GenAI/LLMs and whether an alternative non-generative AI approach e.g. image recognition, natural language processing would be more appropriate.

[AI Playbook for the UK Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-playbook-for-the-uk-government/artificial-intelligence-playbook-for-the-uk-government-html#using-ai-safely-and-responsibly): 'Assess the environmental impact of training and/or deploying your AI system before commencing development. Consider whether the impact represents a reasonable trade-off between benefits and energy consumption, and whether a less energy-intensive system might be able to achieve the same or similar results.'

###  (ii) Choose the appropriate size model

Services will use AI for different tasks. Small AI models can be trained for a specific task, are cost effective, quick (as there is less data for them to reference) and they can be run on basic hardware (such as a PC or phone).

Having good AI evaluation/performance metrics will allow teams to make effective choices about the smallest model they can 'get away with' using.

###  (iii) Reuse existing models where possible

Consider building on an existing model rather than starting a new one from scratch.

###  (iv) Carefully choose supplier and region

Choosing the right AI supplier and location is important. You can reduce the carbon footprint by training models in low-carbon regions or times of day.

Keep in mind the other environmental impacts of AI, especially water use. Always consider regional differences. For example. water use will have a different impact in Scotland than Suffolk.

Use third-party auditors to help select the most environmentally-friendly supplier.

Teams might be able to swap a well-known model for a more sustainable and similarly-effective option (e.g. DistilBERT vs BERT) - especially if they have the service performance metrics to support their decision
