---

A range of actions to reduce the impacts of hardware used by teams designing, developing and operating services. 

Note: many of these policies may be determined at the organisational level, and not by individual teams.

###  (i) Ensure that only necessary devices are provided

Assess the device needs of teams and organisation. gather information on the number of devices required, the reasons for needing them, their necessary functionality based on user roles, the expected lifespan, and other relevant factors.

Choose the right equipment for different roles. For example, make sure inspectors have a suitable device for field work.

Limit peripheral IT equipment like monitors and printers, and consider adoption of 'thin' client devices.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Ensure that only devices that are truly needed are procured and provided

###  (ii) Extend the life of devices where possible

Adopt approaches that will extend the lifespan of devices.

For example, the battery is key and often the first part of a laptop to fail or need replacing. Use power management approaches to extend battery life.

Repair or upgrade existing devices when the benefits clearly outweigh the costs. This means we need to compare the costs of upgrades with their potential benefits, such as improved functionality and extended device lifespan.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Extending the life of devices redcues electronic waste and the embodied impacts of new devices.

###  (iii) Buy refurbished devices

Refurbished devices have been restored to a like-new condition. Buying refurbished hardware can reduce the impact of your devices by up to 85% (Procurement guide)

#### Environmental benefit: 
Purchasing refurbished devices extends the life cycle of existing devices, reducing electronic waste and saving on the impacts coming from minng, processing and manufacturing new devices.

###  (iv) Buy energy efficient devices

Ecolabel certifications like EPEAT and Energy Star identify more energy efficient devices, including:

laptops
desktop computers
monitors
peripherals

Product carbon footprint (PCF) and testing energy loads can also help assess the energy performance of devices

#### Environmental benefit: 
Devcies that are more energy efficient use less energy

###  (v) Manage Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)

Bring your own device (BYOD) is a policy that allows employees to use their personal devices for work. 

Suppliers are responsible for making sure contractors stay within an organisation's device policy.

#### Environmental benefit: 
BYOD reduces environmental impacts of manufacturing new end-user devices. However, employees are left to dispose of devices appropriately at their end-of-life.

###  (vi) Apply appropriate disposal methods across teams and supply chain partners

Recycle old devices. Does your current supplier contract include end-of-life management services?
Establish clear goals and metrics for e-waste collection and recycling

#### Environmental benefit: 
Appropriate end-of-life disposable should mean zero e-waste to landfill and ensure that valuable materials can be recovered.
