###  (i) Consider the full range of online and offline interventions

Developing a new digital service may be one option from a range of possible levers or interventions that government can make, and often government is most effective when it pulls a few different complementary levers or styles of action in combination.

###  (ii) Model outcomes of different interventions

Modelling the impacts of a service and/or other interventions at this stage may enable teams to better understand and predict the potential effects on the environment, economy, or society. Where appropriate, this should include consideration of the systemic effects and impacts on behaviours, such as rebound effects from the use of technology.

This insight can then inform decisions on which interventions are most appropriate, before a project or projects begin.

See Measurement principle.
