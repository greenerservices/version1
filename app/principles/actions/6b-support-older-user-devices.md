###  (i) Develop software that is compatible with older devices

Avoid 'technology induced obsolescence' for older end user devices. New software should be compatible with existing devices. 

Encourage service availability on existing devices by:

• designing for low power, low bandwith devices
• using lightweight technologies and frameworks

#### Environmental benefit: 
Reduce the environmental impacts coming from users replacing devices as far as possible.
