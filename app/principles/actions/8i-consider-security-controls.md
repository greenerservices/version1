###  (i) Avoid duplication of personal data

Reduce the duplication of personal data storage. This reduces the risk and impact if data is compromised.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Reduced data storage

{% from "govuk/components/details/macro.njk" import govukDetails %}

{{ govukDetails({
  summaryText: "Read more",
  text: "Some placeholder text"
}) }}
* * *

###  (ii) Optimise backups and redundancies

Improve your resilience by shortening backup retention times and removing duplicate backups. You should consider:

• if shortening retention times is possible
• the importance of duplicates and storage in security

#### Environmental benefit: 
Reduced data storage.

###  (iii) Choose the right cryptographic algorithms

Cryptographic algorithms are formulas that encrypt and decrypt data. Consider quantum computing and its impact on cryptographic algorithms.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Reduce resource usage.

{% from "govuk/components/details/macro.njk" import govukDetails %}

{{ govukDetails({
  summaryText: "Read more",
  text: "Some placeholder text"
}) }}
* * *

###  (iv) Consider patch management

Optimize security updates to minimize unnecessary software downloads and system reboots.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Save on resource consumption.

  summaryText: "Read more",
  html: "Some placeholder text"

}) }}

* * *

###  (v) Consider timing of security scans and updates

Schedule intensive security scans and updates during off-peak hours to balance energy loads.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Reduce carbon intensity of electricity used.

{% from "govuk/components/details/macro.njk" import govukDetails %}

{{ govukDetails({
  summaryText: "Read more",
  text: "Some placeholder text"
}) }}
* * *

###  (vi) Calculate the emissions of security controls

Calculate the emissions of security controls to identify potential reductions.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Reduce resource comsumption.
