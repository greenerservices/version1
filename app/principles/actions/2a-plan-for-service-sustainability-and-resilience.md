###  (i) Include environmental sustainability in project requirements

When gathering requirements:  

 * identify and prioritise the environmental impacts of project requirements

 * understand the benefits and trade offs between priorities, for example environmental impacts versus user needs or performance

 * understand the risks of keeping parts of an existing service or process

###  (ii) Consider if the the service is resilient to climate change

A climate resilient service is designed to cope with the negative effects of climate change. This means the service can continue to operate despite these risks. 

For each project or service identify:

* potential risks to the service from climate change
* ways to mitigate the risks to the service

###  (iii) Create a project plan to balance priorities

A project plan should balance environmental impacts against other priorities, including:

* user needs
* performance
* security
* cost
* speed of delivery

Understanding the current service baseline will help align the project plan to strategic objectives and sustainability goals.

###  (iv) Develop non-functional requirements for environmental sustainability

Non-functional requirements (NFRs) specify a systemâ€™s capabilities and constraints. 

Services need NFRs to cover environmental impacts. Use key performance indicators and other measures to track progress against green targets.
