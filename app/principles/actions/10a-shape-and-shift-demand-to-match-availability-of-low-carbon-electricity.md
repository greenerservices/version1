The UK electricity grid's carbon intensity varies with the time of day and weather conditions. There are also regional differences with the 'mix' of energy sources available varying significantly between parts of the country. 

Services being 'carbon aware' means responding to shifts in carbon intensity of the electricity grid.

###  (i) Shift workloads to when and where lower carbon electricity is available

Shifting when workloads run can take advantage of lower carbon electricity. For example, later in the day, when it’s sunnier, or at night if it’s windier. This is often called 'temporal demand shifting.'

Shifting workload location means moving workloads from one physical location to another. This is often called 'spatial demand shifting.'

#### Environmental benefit: 
Making use of lower-carbon grid mix reduces the carbon footprint of workloads.

###  (ii) Shape demand based on electricity supply

'Shaping' demand is a concept similiar to shifting time or location, but instead involves shaping demand to the existing electricity supply. 

#### Environmental benefit: 
Doing more work when the grid is greener saves on carbon.
