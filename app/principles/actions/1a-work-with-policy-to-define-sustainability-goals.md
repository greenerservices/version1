###  (i) Understand any policy sustainability goals

Policy might have broad goals for sustainability, including economic, social or environmental outcomes. 

You should be clear about the environmental outcomes your service will help achieve. For example, some Defra services aim to boost material recycling or biodiversity. Some of these goals will include encouraging behavioural change.

###  (ii) Engage in open policymaking where possible

Open policy making can help create policy based on evidence, participation and experimentation. 

It relies on collaborative methods to iterate policy that meets complex and evolving user needs.

It supports real world problem-solving, accountability, and 'socially grounded decision making'.
