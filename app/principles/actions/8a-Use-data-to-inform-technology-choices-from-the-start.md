The right data can allow us to embed environmental sustainability into technology decisions from the start, saving on the impacts of adapting approaches later in a project.

###  (i) Forecast the environmental impact of services and workloads at the solution architecture design stage

Forecast the impact of services and workloads at the solution architecture design stage.

This includes their carbon footprint but is not limited to that. You should use this to inform technology choices and design decisions.

###  (ii) Design for monitoring upfront

Build in consumption and emissions monitoring from the start of the project. You should tag resources where possible.

Think of 'measurable by design' like 'secure by design'. Add energy measurability upfront instead of adding it later.
