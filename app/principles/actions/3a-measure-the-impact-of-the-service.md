###  (i) Set a baseline

Judging the effectiveness of a service in delivering on environmental goals requires that we have something to measure against, a so-called 'baseline'. 

In most cases, a service will be a ‘brownfield’ one and will replace an existing one in some form or other, and this existing (as-is) service can form the baseline against which we measure.

#### Environmental benefit: 
A baseline provides a benchmark against which we can assess the impact of actions to reduce environmental impacts.

###  (ii) Model the environmental impacts of different solutions under consideration

Model the environmental impacts of different solutions when trying them out in alpha. This helps inform decisions about which options to develop.

###  (iii) Choose appropriate metrics 

Measuring the impacts of a service help identify areas for improvement. 

Key performance indicators (KPIs) could focus on:

• carbon per contact or goal completion
• escalation
• alerts
• page load

KPIs can also focus on targets other than carbon, such as water usage, electricity

###  (iv) Publish and share service measurement methods

Sharing how progress against environmental goals is measured encourages and transparency. It also allows us to learn from one another's efforts.
