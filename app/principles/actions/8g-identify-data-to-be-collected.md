###  (i) Only collect data that is necessary

Find out if the data you need has been collected elsewhere and if you can reuse it.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Reducing data storage cuts required infrastructure, power and data transfer.

{% from "govuk/components/details/macro.njk" import govukDetails %}

{{ govukDetails({
  summaryText: "Read more",
  text: "Some placeholder text"
}) }}

###  (ii) Identify opportunities for data sharing

Sharing data might mean it only needs to be collected once, saving on storage.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Reducing data storage cuts required infrastructure, power and data transfer.

{{ govukDetails({
  summaryText: "Read more",
  html: "Some placeholder text"

}) }}
