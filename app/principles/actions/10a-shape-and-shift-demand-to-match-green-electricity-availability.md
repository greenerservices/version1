The UK grid's carbon intensity varies with the time of day and weather conditions. There are also regional differences with the 'mix' of energy sources available varying significantly between parts of the country. 

Services being 'carbon aware' means responding to shifts in carbon intensity of the electricity grid.

###  (i) Shift workloads to when and where carbon intensity is lower  

Shifting when workloads run can take advantage of lower carbon electricity. For example, later in the day, when it’s sunnier, or at night if it’s windier. This is often called 'temporal demand shifting.'

Shifting workload location means moving workloads from one physical location to another. This is often called 'spatial demand shifting.'

###  (ii) Shape demand

Shaping demand means matching workloads to the availability of green electricty. Do more when greener electricity is available and less when the supply is higher carbon.

#### Environmental benefit: 
This sub-action is likely to level medium levels of environmental benefit.
