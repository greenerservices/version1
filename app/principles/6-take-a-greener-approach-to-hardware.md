The Green Software Foundation have developed a set of patterns and techniques to reduce the environmental impacts of digital services. These are broken down by 'web' and 'cloud'.

The W3C's draft Web Sustainability Guidelines include comprehensive recommendations for reducing the environmental impacts of websites and digital products. Guidance comes under the following categories: user experience design, web development, hosting and infrastructure and business and product management considerations.
Handbook of Sustainable Design of Digital Services

The Handbook of Sustainable Design of Digital Services, known as GR491, was created in France by the 'Institute for Sustainable IT'. It covers a range of recommendations for delivering digital services with reduced environmental footprints.
