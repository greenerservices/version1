Hardware has very significant ‘embodied’ environmental impacts coming from the sourcing of raw materials, processing, manufacture, distribution and disposal of equipment at the end of it's life.

These go beyond carbon to include things like:

• freshwater use
• resource depletion
• ozone depletion
• human and ecosystem toxicity


deforestation
bio-diversity loss
land use change

Applying 'circular economy principles' to hardware can include:
sharing
leasing
reusing, repairing and refurbishing
recycling
These approaches help reduce the environmental impacts of manufacturing new kit. 
Cloud, AI and software all need hardware. Doing less in the cloud or using less AI can indirectly reduce the need for more hardware.
